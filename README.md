# Data-Science-Bootcamp
I tried to learn everything about artificial intelligence during this training process, which was realized with the support of the 'Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality'. In this process, I learned machine learning and artificial neural networks, processing data and visualizing them. The libraries I learned are mainly as follows;

Sklearn

Tenserflow

pandas

numpy

matplotlib
